  RUN this code first to create the formats
  for the HELP dataset

  CHANGE the location of the DIRECTORY below

  PROC FORMAT creates a formats.sas7bcat file
  which needs to be in the SAME location
  as your datafile for the formats to be
  applied correctly.

  This code creates the labels for the variables
  and the associated numeric coding
